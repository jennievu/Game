## Who wants to be a millionaire game 
  The game is straightforward , user answer questions and they gain a certain number of point when answer correctly and they lose the name when answer incorrectly. 
### Project Development
  We have a user login and signup pages that allows a personalized experience. As the game is played, the user points are compiled and added to the leaderboard at the end of the game with correspond with their score earned from the game.
  We focus on design a lot on this project because the UI was the aggregate of the project.
We used only 1 main css file to style the login, the game and home page. On the home page, we have section for user can login to the game and a static background. 
### Project Outcomes
  For every question answered correctly, the user will be granted one point. which will be stored in score-info.txt
